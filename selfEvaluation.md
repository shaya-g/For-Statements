# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `for` statement?

I feel that I definitely need more practice with the `for` statement. It is something that requires repetition.

- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?

I definitely had an unproductive struggle because I was working on challenge 2 for over an hour without asking for help. Eventually, I reached out on the main channel in Slack.

- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?

I need to practice `for` statements and somehow retrieving one index position from an array.

- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?

I don't have any other questions left.
